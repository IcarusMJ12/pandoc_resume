Personal Projects
-----------------

[dualshock.pd](https://github.com/megawidget/dualshock.pd)
:	A Pure Data extension that captures Sony DualShock input and translates it
	into human-usable form.

Comes with a rudimentary AM/FM synthesizer, a duophonic synthesizer, a noise
synthesizer, and a drumkit.  Fun but not especially practical.

[ebb](https://github.com/megawidget/ebb)
:	the Expressly Better Bencoder! (*C++11*, *Boost PP*)

Used internally at BitTorrent, this is a heavily template-based header-only
library that simplifies encoding data into a JSON-like format.  Bdecoding is
also supported and is functional for straightforward data structures, but needs
more work to be compatible with .torrent files.

[bevel](https://github.com/megawidget/bevel)
:	A multitool for commandline processing of bencoded entities with grep- and
	sed-like functionality. (*Python*)

Also used internally at BitTorrent for viewing and editing bencoded entities
either manually or in a scripted environment.

[ronin](https://github.com/megawidget/ronin)
:	A roguelike featuring a hex grid and an innovative FOV algorithm. (*Python*,
	*Pygame*)

This is in extremely early stages of development but the FOV algorithm is
complete and demoable.

[Dworkin](https://github.com/megawidget/netrunner-utils)
:	A deck builder for the card game Android: Netrunner. (*CoffeeScript*,
	*Ender.js*, *HTML5*)

Features a minimalistic interface, uses local storage for custom decks, and
allows exporting to tsv as well as OCTGN format that is suitable for online
play.

[cur](https://github.com/megawidget/cur)
:	A copypasta detection tool for codebases. (*Python*)

Uses a suffix trie to detect duplicates and generates a code quality report.

[rat trap parts](https://github.com/megawidget/rat_trap_parts)
:	An anagram-based word game.	(*C++*, *ncurses*)

A cute word game where you try to make new, longer words from prior words by
rearranging letters and adding any one letter of your choice during each step.

Education
---------

Major
:	BA in Computer Science in the Math Department at UCSD

Minor
:	Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts with Music emphasis

*	Completed a Cryptography I course on Coursera as offered by Stanford
	University.
*	Over a year's worth of coursework in Digital Signal Processing and Synthesis
	as it applies to sound, incl. graduate level work. (*Pure Data*, *C*, *C++*)
